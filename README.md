# The List

Here are 3 "Coda Kata"-style sites that I'm interested in (and that I got tired of Googling for whenever my memory triggered me to think about it):

- [Code Kata](http://codekata.com): The inspiration for the name
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): One of the original Math+CS puzzle site
- [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code): A very good measure of how much hard-core passion a language has by all the implemented tasks

### Why am I doing this? 

I got tired of trying to figure out ways to get better as a developer that weren't pedantic. I'm also a [CrossFit](https://crossfit.com) participant and the idea of doing [Metcons](http://www.mensfitness.com/training/build-muscle/what-wod-decoding-language-crossfit) but for code really appealed to me. I wanted to really push myself, too, because that's the only way to get results that I've seen work (for me). (I'm sure there's [some good 4% flow story](http://www.flowgenomeproject.com) that I'm missing....)

### The Languages

I'm primarily interested in learning and getting better at problem-solving in the following **FOUR** languages (in alphabetical order):

- [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Racket](http://racket-lang.org)
- [Swift](https://swift.org)

### Other considerations

These pages definitely influenced my thinking on this stuff:

- [King of the Hill on Rosetta Code](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2015/05/king-of-the-hill-on-rosetta-code.html): This was really inspirational in terms of just how much language passion there is in the Racket Community
- [Why I Don't Do Code Katas](https://hackhands.com/dont-code-katas/): The danger of doing mindless activity and thinking you're improving your skillsets
- [The Ultimate Code Kata](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-code-kata/): Jeff Atwood's very practical instruction on the right mindset for getting better as a software developer
- [Practicing Programming](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming): *"Contrary to what you might believe, merely doing your job every day doesn't qualify as real practice."*
- [How I Built 180 Websites in 180 days and became a YC Fellowship Founder](https://zube.io/blog/how-i-built-180-websites-in-180-days-and-became-a-yc-fellowship-founder/): Jen Dewalt's crazy and inspirational story about how she went from a non-developer to a YC co-founder.
