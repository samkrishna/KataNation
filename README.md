A curated site for awesome Code Kata-type exercises

# The List

Here are a few "Coda Kata"-style sites that look pretty cool:

- [Code Kata](http://codekata.com): The inspiration for the name
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): One of the original Math+CS puzzle site
- [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code): A very good measure of how much hard-core passion a language has by all the implemented tasks
- [Exercism](http://exercism.io)

### Why am I doing this? 

I got tired of trying to figure out ways to get better as a developer that weren't pedantic. I'm also a [CrossFit](https://crossfit.com) participant and the idea of doing [Metcons](http://www.mensfitness.com/training/build-muscle/what-wod-decoding-language-crossfit) but for code really appealed to me. I wanted to really push myself, too, because that's the only way to get results that I've seen work (for me). (I'm sure there's [some good 4% flow story](http://www.flowgenomeproject.com) that I'm missing....)

### The Languages

I'm primarily interested in learning and getting better at problem-solving in the following **FOUR** languages (in alphabetical order):

- [Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)
- [Python](https://www.python.org)
- [Racket](http://racket-lang.org)
- [Swift](https://swift.org)

### Some Solution Sites

I won't lie: [pervasive web searching](https://www.google.com/search?q=project+euler+solutions&oq=project+euler+solutions) has made it infinitely easier to learn things, and the dark side of that ability to learn is the ability to cheat. Rather than pretend to be all noble about it, I'm posting here some sites that I've found that have solutions to the various katas listed above.

- [Project Nayuki](https://www.nayuki.io/page/project-euler-solutions): This guy has been crushing it in terms of Project Euler solutions. He's got stuff for Python, Java, Haskell **AND** Mathematica. Wow.
- [Project Nayuki repo](https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions)
- [Answers.txt from Project Nayuki](https://github.com/nayuki/Project-Euler-solutions/blob/master/Answers.txt)
- [First 150 Project Euler solutions in C#](http://www.mathblog.dk/project-euler-solutions/)
- [Danny Gallardo's Write-up to his Solution to Project Euler #1](https://dannygtech.wordpress.com/2014/05/20/project-euler-objective-c-solutions/)
- [Danny Gallardo's Objective-C solutions to Project Euler](https://github.com/dgallardo01/Project-Euler-Objective-C-Solutions)
- [S. Anand's Euler Solutions](http://www.s-anand.net/euler.html): It seems like he's trying to go for performance in his Python solution sets

### Other considerations

These pages definitely influenced my thinking on this stuff:

- [King of the Hill on Rosetta Code](https://blog.racket-lang.org/2015/05/king-of-the-hill-on-rosetta-code.html): This was really inspirational in terms of just how much language passion there is in the Racket Community
- [Why I Don't Do Code Katas](https://hackhands.com/dont-code-katas/): The danger of doing mindless activity and thinking you're improving your skillsets
- [The Ultimate Code Kata](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ultimate-code-kata/): Jeff Atwood's very practical instruction on the right mindset for getting better as a software developer
- [Practicing Programming](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/practicing-programming): *"Contrary to what you might believe, merely doing your job every day doesn't qualify as real practice."*
- [How I Built 180 Websites in 180 days and became a YC Fellowship Founder](https://zube.io/blog/how-i-built-180-websites-in-180-days-and-became-a-yc-fellowship-founder/): Jen Dewalt's crazy and inspirational story about how she went from a non-developer to a YC co-founder.
